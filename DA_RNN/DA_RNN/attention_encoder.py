    """RNN encoder with attention.
  In this context "attention" means that, during encoding, the RNN can look up
  information in the additional tensor "attention_states", which is constructed by transpose the dimensions of time steps and input features of the inputs,
  and it does this to focus on a few features of the input.

  Args:
    encoder_inputs: A list of 2D Tensors [batch_size x n_input_encoder].
    initial_state: 2D Tensor [batch_size x cell.state_size].
    attention_states: 3D Tensor [batch_size x attn_length x attn_size].
    cell: rnn_cell.RNNCell defining the cell function and size.
    output_size: Size of the output vectors; if None, we use cell.output_size.
    num_heads: Number of attention heads that read from attention_states.
    dtype: The dtype to use for the RNN initial state (default: tf.float32).
    scope: VariableScope for the created subgraph; default: "attention_decoder".

  Returns:
    A tuple of the form (outputs, state, attn_weights), where:
      outputs: A list of the encoder hidden states. Each element is a 2D Tensor of shape [batch_size x output_size]. 
      state: The state of encoder cell at the final time-step. It is a 2D Tensor of shape [batch_size x cell.state_size].
      attn_weights: A list of the input attention weights. Each element is a 2D Tensor of shape [batch_size x attn_length]
  Raises:
    ValueError: when num_heads is not positive, there are no inputs, shapes
      of attention_states are not set, or input size cannot be inferred
      from the input.
